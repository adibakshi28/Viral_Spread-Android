This project was initially built in Unity editor version 2018.xx (The cracked one pro)
But since it only had max support till android API level 27 (Oreo) and when uploaded to play store it complained that max level should be 28(Pie)
So downloaded the latest version of unity ie 2019.xx and imported the project to it
Now when again uploaded to google play it complained about 32 bit to 64 bit nonsense 
Upon searching it was found that Scripting Changed from Mono - > ILT2CPP  && Check both architectures of ARM
Also check the box of google app bundle in Build Setting window  (This results in building a .aab file instead of .apk file)
This was finally uploaded to gogole play

(In the backup version for this project library folder of the project was not saved (too big) as it is regenerated as project is again loaded in unity)
